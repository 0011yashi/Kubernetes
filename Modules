Here's a simplified diagram of Kubernetes architecture:

Master Node:

Contains the main components that manage the cluster:
API Server: The main entry point for all administrative tasks.
Scheduler: Assigns workloads to specific nodes.
Controller Manager: Maintains the desired state of the cluster.
etcd: Stores all cluster data as a key-value store.
Worker Nodes:

Each worker node runs application workloads:
Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, which run one or more containers.
Containers: Encapsulate the application code and dependencies.
Service: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

ConfigMap/Secret: Used to manage configuration data and sensitive information separately from the application code.

This diagram shows how the Master Node controls and manages the cluster, while the Worker Nodes run the actual application components. Services and ConfigMaps help manage application interactions and configurations. ​​

ChatGPT
Kubernetes architecture is designed to provide a highly available, scalable, and resilient environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. Here’s an overview of its key components and how they interact:

Key Components of Kubernetes Architecture
Master Node:

Responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster and orchestrating the various components.
API Server:
The central management entity that exposes the Kubernetes API.
Acts as the front end of the Kubernetes control plane.
etcd:
A consistent and highly available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
Stores the configuration data and the state of the cluster.
Scheduler:
Assigns workloads (Pods) to specific nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
Controller Manager:
Runs controller processes to regulate the state of the cluster.
Includes various controllers like the Replication Controller, Endpoint Controller, and Node Controller.
Worker Nodes:

Run the containerized applications and handle the actual workload.
Kubelet:
An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures that containers are running in a Pod.
Communicates with the API Server to receive and execute instructions.
Kube-proxy:
Manages network connectivity and load balancing for services on a node.
Maintains network rules and allows communication between Pods.
Container Runtime:
The software that is responsible for running the containers.
Examples include Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
Pods:

The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object that can be created or managed.
Represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster.
Can contain one or more containers that share storage, network, and a specification for how to run the containers.
Services:

An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
Enables decoupling between the network identity and the actual workload.
ConfigMaps and Secrets:

ConfigMap: Stores configuration data in key-value pairs.
Secret: Stores sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, and keys.

Interaction and Workflow
API Server:

Users interact with the Kubernetes cluster through the API Server using kubectl commands or API calls.
The API Server validates and processes the requests.
Scheduler:

Watches for newly created Pods that have no assigned node.
Selects a node for them based on resource requirements and scheduling policies.
Controller Manager:

Monitors the state of the cluster through the API Server.
Makes necessary changes to maintain the desired state, such as scaling applications or handling node failures.
etcd:

Stores the state of all cluster components persistently.
Provides consistency across the cluster.
Worker Nodes:

Kubelet on each worker node receives instructions from the API Server to run containers in Pods.
Kube-proxy ensures that networking rules are applied, allowing communication between Pods and Services.
Pods and Containers:

Pods encapsulate containers, allowing them to share resources.
Containers run the application workloads.
Services and Configurations:

Services provide a stable endpoint for accessing Pods.
ConfigMaps and Secrets manage application configuration and sensitive information securely.
